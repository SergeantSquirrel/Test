             <h2>Welcome to my website that gives you an insight about me!</h2>
             <p>I will start will a basic bio of myself and then please follow the prompts below to navigate through the pages :)</p>
             <p>I am currently 22, graduated high school in 2016 and went straight into studying Engineering at University of Queensland.
               I did first year there but did not overly enjoy Engineering and therefore transferred to QUT (Queensland University of Technology),
               to major in electrical and aerospace engineering. Unfortunately, I still did not enjoy what I was studying and decided to pick another career path;
               I followed wrong advice from my career’s counsellor at QUT and did a year of a Bachelor of
               Justice until I moved down to Melbourne in January of 2021 and took up a Bachelor of IT, hoping to major in cyber security.</p>
             <p>During the back and forth of finding a degree I wanted to pursue, I managed to work full time here and there,
                complete a Certificate 3 in Civil Construction and get work experience in many different industries. I was able to
                 fund many of my hobbies which included building my own computer, anything to do with my cars and visiting as many
                 pubs as possible. I like to think the choice to prioritise work over studying taught me the importance of getting a degree.
                  While the money was good for a short period of time, career progression really became for my future. By 22, I have lived out of
                  home for 4 years, had 5 different cars, been engaged, travelled and experienced things that just wouldn’t be possible if I chose
                  to prioritise study. </p>
                  <p>Beyond all this, I love photography, although I have never pursued it, I have many favourites of my own work which I like to share on Instagram,
                     however I will link a small gallery to showcase my hobby. </p>
